Style guides
============

The next pages contains a summary of the most important parts of the guidelines
used to write docstrings or code with Python. Both of them contains links to 
the original source if you want to read them.

If you want to go begin the tutorial as soon as posible I'll recomend to read 
only the docstrings guidelines and leave the code style for later because the 
tutorial is not dependant on the style of your code.
